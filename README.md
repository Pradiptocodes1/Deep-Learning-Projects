Repository of my deep learning projects in Computer Vision

1. MNIST using CNN
The MNIST dataset is known as the get go dataset for deep learning beginners. This dataset is used for handwritten digits classification. I implemented Convolutional Neural Network on this MNIST dataset, with 2 convolutional layers (with Relu activation function), 2x2 max pooling and 2 fully connected layers to train the model. I used 11 epochs which gave the final accuracy result as 98.280% on the test dataset and took 20 minutes to train.
